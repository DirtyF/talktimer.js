Managing a conference is nice. Ensuring talks finish on time is part of the deal you have
with your audience.

As I can't guaranty the quality of your speakers, `talktimer.js` is a tool that
nearly guaranties talks to finish on time.

Why? Because the speaker will have that displayed on a tablet device, with a browser
opened on a webpage.

## Principles

`talktimer.js` is a set of decoupled elements, relying on UI events.
It is then delivered as a fully working component, you can extend without touching
the code, nor extending it.

## Usage

```javascript
<script src="/path/to/talktimer.js"></script>
<script>
var talktimer = new Talktimer('#timer');
talktimer.start();
</script>
```
